    <h3>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS by Hermann Sudermann</h3>
    <p>FRAU LINDEMANN. There! Now she can come--curtains, bedding--
        everything fresh and clean as new! No, this honor, this unexpected
        honor--! Barons and counts have been here often enough. Even the
        Russian princes sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother
        my head about them--they're just like--that!--But a princess--a real
        princess!</p>
    <p>ROSA. Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all</p>
    <p>FRAU LINDEMANN. [Indignantly.] What? What do you mean by
        that!</p>
    <p>ROSA. I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to
        an inn like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and
        velvets. You just wait and see; it's a trick! 
        </p>
    <p>FRAU LINDEMANN. Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't
        genuine; that the letter is a forgery? 
        </p>
    <p>ROSA. Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
        student, Herr Strübel, he's always joking. [Giggles.</p>
    <p>FRAU LINDEMANN. When Herr Strübel makes a joke he makes a
        decent joke, a real, genuine joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to
        be angry sometimes--but as for writing a forged letter--My land!--a
        letter with a gold crown on it--there! [She takes a letter from her waist
        and reads.] "This afternoon Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern,
        will stop at the Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the
        descent to the Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and
        comfortable room, to guard Her Highness from any annoying
        advances, and, above all, to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding
        this event, as otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness
        von Brook, maid of honor to Her Highness." Now, what have you got
        to say?
